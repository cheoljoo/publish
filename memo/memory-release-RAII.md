- In C++, automatic memory management is typically handled by using RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles, where resource allocation and deallocation are tied to object lifetimes. When an object goes out of scope, its destructor is called, and any resources it owns are released. This pattern is used not only for mutexes, as with std::lock_guard, but also for memory management.

- Here are a few ways C++ can automatically manage memory to avoid manual memory deallocation:

    1. Stack Allocation: Variables declared on the stack are automatically destroyed and their memory is released when they go out of scope.
        ```cpp
            void function() {
                int stackVariable = 42; // Allocated on the stack
                // No need to free, it will be automatically released when 'function' returns
            }
        ```

    2. Smart Pointers: C++ provides smart pointers, like std::unique_ptr and std::shared_ptr, which automatically manage the memory of dynamically allocated objects. When a smart pointer goes out of scope, its destructor is called, and it frees the memory it owns.
        ```cpp
        #include <memory>

        void function() {
            std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(42)); // Use make_unique in C++14 and later
            // No need to delete, memory will be automatically released when 'ptr' goes out of scope
        }
        ```

    3. Standard Containers: Standard library containers like std::vector, std::string, etc., manage their own memory. When a container object is destroyed, its destructor releases the memory used by the container elements.
        ```cpp
        #include <vector>

        void function() {
            std::vector<int> vec = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
            // No need to free, memory will be automatically released when 'vec' goes out of scope
        }
        ```

- In these examples, you don't need to explicitly free memory or call a function to do so. The destructors of the objects will take care of that automatically when they go out of scope, either at the end of the function or when the block in which they are defined ends. This automatic memory management is one of the key advantages of modern C++ and helps prevent memory leaks and other memory management errors.
