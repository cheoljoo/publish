1. **"overweight (100kg) and less-weight (less than 43kg)"**

   - **Correction:** "underweight (less than 43kg)"  
2. **"are checking point whether he has strong body"**

- >> gpt : In my case, I need the internet. Nowadays, I cannot live without it. He is a caretaker. We need more caretakers in Korea in the future because our country is aging. We have a serious problem with a decreasing population.
1. **"in my case , i need the internet."**  
   - **Error:**  
     - "i" should be capitalized.  
     - The space before the comma is unnecessary.  
   - **Correction:**  
     - "In my case, I need the internet."
2. **"nowadays i can not live without internet."**  
   - **Error:**  
     - "i" should be capitalized.  
     - "can not" should be corrected to "cannot" (preferred spelling in modern English).  
     - "internet" needs "the" for proper grammar, as it refers to a specific entity.  
     - "internet" is redundant in the second clause; "it" works better for fluency.  
   - **Correction:**  
     - "Nowadays, I cannot live without it."

     - Missing article ("a") before "caretaker."

- Caliverse offers an advanced ecosystem where the virtual world closely interacts with real-world environments. Korea’s leading ICT company, Lotte Innovate Co., has unveiled its new metaverse platform, Caliverse, at CES 2025 in Las Vegas.
- my sentence : We can make the game based on real worlds. It will be new starter of game. But already many game companies tried to make a metaverse game and they did not have good results. I guess they will fail if they sell their virtual something (goods, buildings,territorials,etc).  If they can buy something in caliverse , it is better to deliver it to their real home. I hope that they make new big screen on the glasses. So it make a better life that glasses can replace monitor screen. Additionaly glasses memorize all scenes and they search the location including it when I want some products.
- gpt : We can create a game based on real-world settings. It will be a new beginning for games. However, many game companies have already tried to make metaverse games, and they did not achieve good results. I believe they will fail if they only sell virtual items (e.g., goods, buildings, territories). If players can purchase something in the metaverse, it would be better if it could also be delivered to their real homes. I hope they develop new large screens for glasses so that glasses can replace monitor screens, improving our lives. Additionally, the glasses could memorize all scenes and help locate products by identifying the scenes when I need them.
1. **"We can make the game based on real worlds."**
   - **Error:** "make the game" is awkward and too specific; "create a game" is more appropriate. "real worlds" should be "real-world settings" for clarity.
   - **Correction:** "We can create a game based on real-world settings."
2. **"It will be new starter of game."**
   - **Error:** "new starter" is awkward and incorrect; "a new beginning" is more natural. "of game" should be "for games."
   - **Correction:** "It will be a new beginning for games."
3. **"But already many game companies tried to make a metaverse game and they did not have good results."**
   - **Error:** Starting with "But" is informal; "However" is better. "already" should be placed after "many game companies" for better flow. "did not have good results" should be "did not achieve good results" for more formal phrasing.
   - **Correction:** "However, many game companies have already tried to make metaverse games, and they did not achieve good results."
4. **"I guess they will fail if they sell their virtual something (goods, buildings,territorials,etc)."**
   - **Error:** "guess" is informal; "believe" is more appropriate. "virtual something" is vague; "virtual items" is better. "territorials" is incorrect; "territories" is the correct term.
   - **Correction:** "I believe they will fail if they only sell virtual items (e.g., goods, buildings, territories)."
5. **"If they can buy something in caliverse , it is better to deliver it to their real home."**
   - **Error:** "caliverse" should be capitalized ("Caliverse"). "it is better to deliver" is awkward; "it would be better if it could also be delivered" is clearer and more precise.
   - **Correction:** "If players can purchase something in the metaverse, it would be better if it could also be delivered to their real homes."
6. **"I hope that they make new big screen on the glasses."**
   - **Error:** "new big screen on the glasses" is awkward; "new large screens for glasses" is more natural.
   - **Correction:** "I hope they develop new large screens for glasses."
7. **"So it make a better life that glasses can replace monitor screen."**
   - **Error:** "it make" should be "it makes." "better life that glasses can replace monitor screen" is awkward; "so that glasses can replace monitor screens, improving our lives" is better phrased.
   - **Correction:** "so that glasses can replace monitor screens, improving our lives."
8. **"Additionaly glasses memorize all scenes and they search the location including it when I want some products."**
   - **Error:** "Additionaly" should be "Additionally." "memorize all scenes and they search the location including it" is unclear; "memorize all scenes and help locate products by identifying the scenes" is clearer.
   - **Correction:** "Additionally, the glasses could memorize all scenes and help locate products by identifying the scenes when I need them."

- Xpeng is a new company not to hear it. I think that this is just a product for CES 2025. It does not realistic becaue why does a car load the helicopter. China has a great company (JDI) for drone. It is the first and best product for drone. 
### 1.6.1. Corrected Text
Xpeng is a **relatively** new company, and many people might not have heard of it. I think their product showcased at CES 2025 seems more like a concept rather than something realistic. Why would a car carry a helicopter? China already has a great company, JDI, specializing in drones. They are known for creating one of the first and best drone products.
### 1.6.2. Explanation of Changes
1. **"Xpeng is a new company not to hear it." → "Xpeng is a relatively new company, and many people might not have heard of it.":** Improved sentence structure for clarity and grammatical accuracy.
2. **"I think that this is just a product for CES 2025." → "I think their product showcased at CES 2025 seems more like a concept rather than something realistic.":** Changed wording to provide a more precise and formal tone.
3. **"It does not realistic becaue why does a car load the helicopter." → "Why would a car carry a helicopter?":** Rephrased for grammatical correctness and clarity.
4. **"China has a great company (JDI) for drone." → "China already has a great company, JDI, specializing in drones.":** Enhanced readability and specificity.
5. **"It is the first and best product for drone." → "They are known for creating one of the first and best drone products.":** Corrected grammar and improved sentence flow.
### 1.6.3. Additional GPT Opinion
The concept of integrating a helicopter with a car might appear unrealistic at first glance, but it could signify an ambitious step towards advancing mobility solutions, particularly for urban air mobility. While China's JDI is indeed a leader in drone technology, Xpeng's exploration into such concepts may push boundaries and inspire innovation. Emerging technologies often start as seemingly impractical ideas before becoming mainstream. Therefore, while skepticism is valid, such initiatives could potentially shape the future of transportation.

- Dunkin Donuts reduces his name to Dunkin. He dropped Donuts. But donuts is very popular product. Some states of America have shortage of donuts. I heard that generally government supports Dunkin donuts to policeman. Why do Americans think like this? Do they have any special story for this donuts?
### 1.8.1. Corrected Text
Dunkin' Donuts has shortened its name to Dunkin', dropping "Donuts." However, donuts remain a very popular product. Some states in America are even experiencing a shortage of donuts. I heard that the government generally supports Dunkin' Donuts for police officers. Why do Americans think this way? Is there a special story behind donuts?
### 1.8.2. Explanation of Changes
1. **"Dunkin Donuts reduces his name to Dunkin." → "Dunkin' Donuts has shortened its name to Dunkin', dropping 'Donuts.'":** Changed "reduces his name" to "has shortened its name" for grammatical correctness and better word choice. Added "dropping 'Donuts'" for clarity about what was removed. Corrected the company name to "Dunkin' Donuts" with the correct punctuation.
2. **"He dropped Donuts." → Merged into the first sentence:** Avoid repetition by integrating this point into the first sentence.
3. **"But donuts is very popular product." → "However, donuts remain a very popular product.":** Replaced "But" with "However" for a more formal tone. Changed "donuts is" to "donuts remain" to match subject-verb agreement and the plural noun "donuts." Added "a" before "very popular product" for proper article usage.
4. **"Some states of America have shortage of donuts." → "Some states in America are even experiencing a shortage of donuts.":** Replaced "of America" with "in America" for correct prepositional usage. Changed "have shortage" to "are even experiencing a shortage" for better phrasing and natural flow.
5. **"I heard that generally government supports Dunkin donuts to policeman." → "I heard that the government generally supports Dunkin' Donuts for police officers.":** Added "the" before "government" for correct article usage. Changed "generally government" to "the government generally" for proper word order. Corrected "to policeman" to "for police officers" to ensure appropriate phrasing and pluralization.
6. **"Why do Americans think like this?" → "Why do Americans think this way?":** Replaced "like this" with "this way" for a more natural and idiomatic expression.
7. **"Do they have any special story for this donuts?" → "Is there a special story behind donuts?":** Replaced "Do they have any" with "Is there a" for conciseness and correctness. Changed "for this donuts" to "behind donuts" to use the correct preposition and remove the extra determiner.

- words
  - extinction :  the state or situation that results when something (such as a plant or animal species) has died out completely. e.g. Several bird species are threatened with extinction.
- Many species are in extinction. They need to be supported the fresh water. However the volume of fresh water will be decreased.  What is the main reason of water pollution? Dam or Climate Change or River Dry.  Maybe shortage of the fresh water gave the effect to california wildfires. Remember only 1 % of planet's surface has fresh water. We should save them.
### 1.9.1. Corrected Text
- Many species are facing extinction. They need access to fresh water for survival. However, the volume of fresh water is decreasing. What is the main cause of water pollution? Is it dams, climate change, or rivers drying up? Perhaps the shortage of fresh water has contributed to the California wildfires. Remember, only 1% of the planet's surface is covered with fresh water. We must work to preserve it.

### 1.11.1. Corrected Text
Trump has returned. He aims to restore the greatness of America. To achieve this, he must raise the country’s economic status. Nowadays, America promotes sales, discounts, and fast food deals. The most notable promotion is from McDonald’s, which offers an extra item for just $1 when customers purchase a $5 product. This phenomenon stems from inflation. As you know, the U.S. stock market has been in a bull market, indicating a positive economic forecast. Generally, the stock market reflects the expected economic status six months ahead.

- This article talked about the importance of drinking plenty of water.  
What is your focus for next year?  
I will continue doing Pilates and avoid drinking soda (including zero-calorie Coke) to improve my health.  
I will write a work diary to record what I do and measure my progress throughout the year.  
I will make it a habit to write down memos for my ideas, as they will be helpful for my work in the future.  
I will organize useful YouTube content efficiently by using the "Watch Later" function.  
Otherwise, I might waste my time watching unproductive gossip videos. 
### 1.13.2. Corrections and Explanations:
1. **"This article said about importance of drinking plenty of water."** → **"This article talked about the importance of drinking plenty of water."** - "Said about" is incorrect; "talked about" is the correct phrase. - "Importance of drinking plenty of water" needs "the" before "importance" to be grammatically correct.  
2. **"What is your focus on next year?"** → **"What is your focus for next year?"** - "Focus on" is correct when used as a verb, but as a noun, "focus for next year" is better.  
3. **"I will continue pilates"** → **"I will continue doing Pilates"** - "Continue Pilates" is understandable but unnatural; "continue doing Pilates" is clearer. - "Pilates" should be capitalized because it is a proper noun.  
4. **"not drink soda (zero-coke)"** → **"avoid drinking soda (including zero-calorie Coke)"** - "Not drink" is grammatically possible but unnatural; "avoid drinking" sounds better. - "Zero-coke" should be "zero-calorie Coke" for clarity.  
5. **"I will write my work diary to leave what I work and to measure what I do this year."** → **"I will write a work diary to record what I do and measure my progress throughout the year."** - "Leave what I work" is unclear; "record what I do" makes more sense. - "Measure what I do" is better expressed as "measure my progress." - "This year" should be "throughout the year" for better flow.  
6. **"I will emphasize to write the memo for my idea."** → **"I will make it a habit to write down memos for my ideas."** - "Emphasize to write" is incorrect; "make it a habit to write down" is a natural alternative. - "The memo for my idea" → "memos for my ideas" sounds more natural.  
7. **"It will be helpful what I work in the future."** → **"They will be helpful for my work in the future."** - "It" should be "They" (referring to memos). - "What I work" is incorrect; "for my work" is the correct phrasing.  
8. **"I will show the helpful youtube items efficiently."** → **"I will organize useful YouTube content efficiently."** - "Show" is incorrect in this context; "organize" fits better. - "Helpful YouTube items" → "useful YouTube content" sounds more natural.  
9. **"So I will use 'watch later' function."** → **"I will use the 'Watch Later' function."** - "Watch Later" should be capitalized as it is a feature name. - "Function" needs "the" before it.  
10. **"Otherwise I will spend my time to watch wasted gasip items."** → **"Otherwise, I might waste my time watching unproductive gossip videos."** - "Spend my time to watch" → "waste my time watching" is the correct phrasing. - "Wasted gasip items" is unclear; "unproductive gossip videos" is more natural. - Added a comma after "Otherwise" for better readability.

5. **"againt"** → **"against"**  
   - Spelling correction.  
6. **"his neighbor contries"** → **"his neighboring countries"**

### 1.15.2. Corrections and Explanations:
1. **"Why do you quit earlier to be freelancer?"** → **"Why did you quit earlier to become a freelancer?"**  
   - "Do" should be "did" because the sentence refers to a past action.  
   - "To be freelancer" should be "to become a freelancer" (correct phrasing).  
2. **"What if you can not find jobs?"** → **"What if you cannot find a job?"**  
   - "Can not" should be "cannot" (single word).  
   - "Jobs" should be singular ("a job") since it refers to finding employment in general.  
3. **"He prepared the reasons for this question."** → **"He prepared reasons for this question."**  
   - "The reasons" is unnecessary; "reasons" alone is sufficient.  
4. **"He does not have any opportunities to improve and satisfaction even if he works hard."** → **"He does not have any opportunities for improvement or satisfaction, even if he works hard."**

8. **"We can earn enough money for you as a normal person."** → **"You can earn enough money to live a normal life."**  
   - "We can earn" should be "You can earn" (to match the previous subject).

9. **"You are you to stay your identity."** → **"You are free to maintain your identity."**

### 1.16.1. Corrected Text
- When I saw these barefoot shoes, they looked like a combination of slippers and toe sandals. However, Balenciaga's product, the Zero, is very expensive. The reason is that the company is a luxury brand. They exist in their own league and do not need to step outside their niche. It is weird. They want to sell them because they made each product in various colors. Vogue said it would be a popular product this year. Oh my goodness.
### 1.16.2. Explanation of Mistakes:
1. **"this shoes" → "these barefoot shoes"**  
   - *this shoes* is incorrect because *shoes* is plural, so it should be *these shoes*.  
   - The word *barefoots* does not work in English; *barefoot shoes* is the correct term.
2. **"it is combination with" → "they looked like a combination of"**  
   - *it is combination with* is unnatural.  
   - *combination with* should be *combination of*.  
   - *it is* does not fit well; *they looked like* is a better phrase.
3. **"one tow sandal" → "toe sandals"**  
   - *tow* is a misspelling; it should be *toe*.  
   - *one toe sandal* is not natural in this context. *toe sandals* sounds better.
4. **"Balenciaga's products (Zero)" → "Balenciaga's product, the Zero,"**  
   - Parentheses around *Zero* are unnecessary; a comma is better.  
   - *products* should be singular (*product*) because *Zero* refers to a specific item.
5. **"Reason is the name of this company as luxury brand." → "The reason is that the company is a luxury brand."**  
   - *Reason is* is not a correct structure.  
   - *the name of this company as luxury brand* is grammatically awkward.  
   - The correct way to express this idea is *the company is a luxury brand*.
6. **"They live only in their own league." → "They exist in their own league."**  
   - *live in their own league* is an unnatural phrase.  
   - *exist in their own league* is the correct expression.
7. **"I think they do not need to go outside from their fields." → "They do not need to step outside their niche."**  
   - *go outside from* is incorrect. It should be either *go outside* or *step outside*.  
   - *fields* is not the best word choice. *niche* is a better fit in this context.
8. **"It is wired." → "It is weird."**  
   - *wired* means "connected with wires," while *weird* means "strange." The intended meaning here is *weird*.
9. **"They want to sell it because they made various color each product." → "They want to sell them because they made each product in various colors."**  
   - *sell it* should be *sell them* because *shoes* is plural.  
   - *various color* should be *various colors* (plural).  
   - The phrase *each product various color* is incorrect in word order. The correct phrasing is *each product in various colors*.
10. **"Vogue said that it will be popular proudct this year." → "Vogue said it would be a popular product this year."**  
    - *it will be* should be *it would be* to match past tense (*said*).  
    - *proudct* is a spelling mistake; it should be *product*.
11. **"Oh! my Godness." → "Oh my goodness."**  
    - *Oh! my Godness* is unnatural. The correct phrase is *Oh my goodness*.

### 1.17.1. **Corrected Version**
The nicer you are, the happier you are. Agreeableness has positive effects in life. High agreeableness includes the following traits. I can do only a few things. These are helpful: getting along well with others, having emotional intelligence, working well in teams, making friends easily, and finding it hard to say no. But I cannot do all of them. For example, mediating conflicts, being slow to judge, being more generous, and not being competitive. These traits should be inborn. It is not easy to develop agreeableness through practice.
### 1.17.2. **Corrections & Explanations**
1. **"Agreeableness gives the positive effects in life." → "Agreeableness has positive effects in life."**  
   - **Error:** "Gives" is incorrect here; "has" is more natural when talking about possessing qualities.  
   - **"The positive effects" → "positive effects"**: "Positive effects" is a general concept, so "the" is unnecessary.  
2. **"High Agreeableness include the following things." → "High agreeableness includes the following traits."**  
   - **Error:** "Include" should be "includes" because "High agreeableness" is singular.  
   - **"things" → "traits"**: "Traits" is a better word choice when describing personality characteristics.  
3. **"I can do just several things." → "I can do only a few things."**  
   - **Error:** "Just several" is unnatural; "only a few" sounds more natural.  
4. **"These are helpful , get along well with others, emotional intelligence , work well in teams , make friends easily , hard to say NO." → "These are helpful: getting along well with others, having emotional intelligence, working well in teams, making friends easily, and finding it hard to say no."**  
   - **Error:** The list lacks parallel structure.  
   - **"hard to say NO" → "finding it hard to say no"**: Needs to be restructured to match the other phrases.  
   - **Comma (,) should be replaced with a colon (:)** before listing.  
5. **"But I can not do them." → "But I cannot do all of them."**  
   - **Error:** "Can not" → "Cannot" (correct spelling in this context).  
   - **"Them" is vague; "all of them" clarifies the meaning.**  
6. **"For example, meditating conflict , slow to judge , more generous , not competitive." → "For example, mediating conflicts, being slow to judge, being more generous, and not being competitive."**  
   - **Error:** "Meditating conflict" → "Mediating conflicts" (wrong word choice; "meditate" means to reflect, "mediate" means to resolve disputes).  
   - **"More generous" → "Being more generous"**: Maintains parallel structure.  
   - **Added "and" before the last item for correct list format.**  
7. **"It should these items from born." → "These traits should be inborn."**  
   - **Error:** Incorrect word order and grammar. "Inborn" means "present at birth," which fits the intended meaning.  
8. **"It is not easy to change into agreeableness with practice." → "It is not easy to develop agreeableness through practice."**  
   - **Error:** "Change into agreeableness" is unnatural; "develop agreeableness" is more correct.  
   - **"With practice" → "Through practice"**: "Through" is the correct preposition for describing gradual development.

- rewrite after correction (check my memory) : The Doomsday clock is a symbol of threads of humanity. It moves closer to midnight. It is very dangerous status. For example , climate change , nuclear war , artificial intelligence are big risks. It serves a warning to global leader about natural disasters. Who will be responsible for potential disasters.
### 1.18.1. Revised Sentences:
The Doomsday Clock is a symbol of the threats to humanity. It moves closer to midnight, indicating a very dangerous status. For example, climate change, nuclear war, and artificial intelligence are major risks. It serves as a warning to global leaders about potential disasters. Who is responsible for natural disasters?  
### 1.18.2. Changes and Explanations:
1. **"Doomsday clock is the symbol of anti humanity." → "The Doomsday Clock is a symbol of the threats to humanity."**  
   - "Doomsday clock" → "The Doomsday Clock": Added "The" since it is a proper noun.  
   - "the symbol" → "a symbol": Changed "the" to "a" because it is one of many possible symbols.  
   - "anti humanity" → "the threats to humanity": "anti humanity" is unnatural, so it was reworded for clarity.  
2. **"It moves the closet to midnight." → "It moves closer to midnight."**  
   - "the closet" → "closer": Corrected "closet" (a storage space) to "closer" (a comparative adjective).  
   - Removed "the": Unnecessary before the comparative form "closer."  
3. **"It is very dangerous status." → "indicating a very dangerous status."**  
   - "It is" → "indicating": Changed to a present participle for smoother connection.  
   - Added "a" before "status": "Status" is a countable noun in this context.  
4. **"For example , climate chage , nuclear war , artificial intelligence and so on." → "For example, climate change, nuclear war, and artificial intelligence are major risks."**  
   - "climate chage" → "climate change": Fixed the typo.  
   - "artificial intelligence and so on." → "artificial intelligence are major risks.": Removed "and so on" for a more formal tone and completed the sentence.  
5. **"It will give the warning to global leaders about disaster." → "It serves as a warning to global leaders about potential disasters."**  
   - "will give the warning" → "serves as a warning": More natural phrasing.  
   - "disaster" → "potential disasters": Plural form makes more sense in context.  
6. **"Who is responsible for natural disasters." → "Who is responsible for natural disasters?"**  
   - Added a question mark: Needed for a proper interrogative sentence.

They survived by rising due to water flooding. But movies are not the real world. Japan frequently experiences earthquakes. Sinkholes become more serious when an earthquake and a sinkhole occur together. They can cause tremendous damage.  
### 1.19.2. Changes and Explanations:
1. **"Tokyo had a big sinkhold to swallow the 3 tons truck." → "Tokyo had a large sinkhole that swallowed a 3-ton truck."**  
   - "big" → "large": "Large" sounds more natural for describing a sinkhole.  
   - "sinkhold" → "sinkhole": Corrected the spelling.  
   - "to swallow" → "that swallowed": Changed to a relative clause for proper structure.  
   - "the 3 tons truck" → "a 3-ton truck": Changed "the" to "a" and corrected "tons" to "ton" (adjective form).  
2. **"The size is bigger than 40 meters." → "Its size was over 40 meters."**  
   - "The size" → "Its size": More natural phrasing.  
   - "is" → "was": Past tense needed to match the rest of the sentence.  
   - "bigger than" → "over": "Over" sounds more natural in this context.  
3. **"Commonly there are sinkholes when they use lots of under wastewater." → "Sinkholes commonly occur when excessive underground wastewater is used."**  
   - "Commonly there are sinkholes" → "Sinkholes commonly occur": More natural sentence structure.  
   - "they use lots of under wastewater" → "excessive underground wastewater is used": "Under wastewater" is incorrect; "underground wastewater" is the correct term.  
4. **"I saw the sinkhole movie in netflix." → "I saw the sinkhole movie on Netflix."**  
   - "in Netflix" → "on Netflix": "On" is the correct preposition for streaming platforms.  
5. **"They can survive rising becase of water flooding." → "They survived by rising due to water flooding."**  
   - "can survive" → "survived": Past tense for consistency.  
   - "rising becase of" → "by rising due to": More natural phrasing and spelling correction ("becase" → "because").  
6. **"But moive is not realworld." → "But movies are not the real world."**  
   - "moive" → "movie": Spelling correction.  
   - "movie is" → "movies are": Plural form is more natural.  
   - "realworld" → "the real world": Added "the" and separated "real world" for proper grammar.  
7. **"Japan has earthquake frequently." → "Japan frequently experiences earthquakes."**  
   - "has earthquake" → "experiences earthquakes": "Experiences" is a better verb for natural disasters.  
   - "frequently" moved before the verb for natural word order.  
8. **"Sinkholes are serious when earthquake and sinkhole meet." → "Sinkholes become more serious when an earthquake and a sinkhole occur together."**  
   - "are serious" → "become more serious": More natural phrasing.  
   - "earthquake and sinkhole meet" → "an earthquake and a sinkhole occur together": More precise wording.  
9. **"They will give huge (tremendoze) damages." → "They can cause tremendous damage."**  
   - "will give" → "can cause": "Cause" is the correct verb for damage.  
   - "huge (tremendoze) damages" → "tremendous damage": "Tremendoze" is a misspelling; "damage" is an uncountable noun, so no plural form.

- Rifts are fuel for politicians. They seek opportunities in divisions within communities. We need humility and mutual support to work together. Why do politicians emphasize selfishness over unity? Can they bridge the divisions? Let's respect each other!
### learnt
- Practice humility : To cultivate a more peaceful working environment, executives, managers and employees can practice humility. That means seeing ourselves as equal and not superior to our colleagues and subordinates, and recognizing that no one has all the right answers.
- Find your supporters and know your rights : In some situations, a more guarded approach is warranted. If political talk feels like a personal attack, you may need to find allies who can help you process what you’re hearing and feeling. (weakness)
- Foster fun conversations : One way managers can try to bridge divides is to create rituals for employees to share what’s important to them, Gutman said. This can help build a baseline of **trust** within an organization.
